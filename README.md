    Completed Functions
    [X] Added labels to the wheel.
    [X] Positioned the labels correctly using trigonometric functions.
    [X] Implemented the pointer at the top of the wheel.
    [X] Added containers for displaying the number of subscriptions left for the next spin.
    [X] Added a container for displaying the total number of gifted subscriptions.
    [X] Implemented a spin counter to track the number of available spins.
    [X] Displayed the spin counter container when spins are available.
    [X] Added a button to spin the wheel.
    [X] Controlled the visibility and enabled state of the spin button based on the spin counter.
    [X] Implemented the wheel spinning animation with easing.
    [X] Ensured the wheel stops correctly after spinning.
    [X] Created a function to simulate subscription increments.
    [X] Updated the subscription counters dynamically.
    [X] Displayed the total number of subscriptions for a brief period when required.
    [X] Implemented a function to fetch and handle server requests for showing subscriptions.
      

    Incomplete Functions
    [ ] Need to implement actual data fetching from the server instead of simulation.
    [ ] Add error handling for fetch requests and other asynchronous operations.
    [ ] Additional UI enhancements such as animations, sound effects, and visual feedback for the spin result.
    [ ] Refactor the code for better readability and maintainability.
    [ ] Optimize performance for smoother operation.
